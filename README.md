# World of Academy
Teamwork in C# OOP Course in Telerik Academy 2016-2017 Season.

**WOA** is a RPG console based game

The life in the academy is hard... It is getting even harder when the time for exam comes.
In our game there are two main Characters: students and trainers. <br />
Students are different types, they have different competences. They also have pets which can help them(in most cases).<br />
Trainers can be two types: trainers from the current season and trainers from previous seasons(retired).
The main difference between them is that current season trainers can assign exams and previous season trainers can be called by students when they need help.

Currently supported commands:<br />
create trainer {name}<br />
create student {name}<br />
status {name}<br />
startexam {trainer-name}<br />
